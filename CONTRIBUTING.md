## Pull Requests

We use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for contributions.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch.

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
