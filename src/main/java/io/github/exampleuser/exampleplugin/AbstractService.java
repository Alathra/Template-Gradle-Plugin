/**
 * Abstract base implementation of {@link ServiceLifecycle} that provides thread-safe
 * state management and lifecycle coordination.
 *
 * <p>This implementation uses template methods {@link #startup()} and {@link #shutdown()}
 * that subclasses must implement to provide their specific initialization and cleanup logic.
 * The state transitions are handled automatically by this base class.
 *
 * <p>State transitions are atomic and thread-safe. Only one thread can initiate a state
 * transition at a time, and all other threads will see consistent state during transitions.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyService extends AbstractService {
 *     private DatabaseConnection connection;
 *
 *     @Override
 *     protected void startup() throws Exception {
 *         connection = new DatabaseConnection();
 *         connection.connect();
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     protected void shutdown() throws Exception {
 *         if (connection != null) {
 *             connection.disconnect();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
