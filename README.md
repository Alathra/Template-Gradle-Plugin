## Description

This is a configured and ready to go template for making Minecraft plugins. It includes a plethora of useful
boilerplate, libraries and examples to quickly get you going when creating a new plugin.

All of the included libraries and tooling has been hand-picked for its stability and extendability. Its purpose is to
minimize duplicated code, while providing powerful and ergonomic ways of working with the Bukkit API, databases,
configuration and repository maintenance.

## Setup

1. #### Change [.github/CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS)
   Replace `GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
    ```CODEOWNERS
    *       @darksaid98 @SOME_OTHER_USER
    ```
2. #### Change [.github/FUNDING.yml](./.github/FUNDING.yml)
   Replace `GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub
   username. [You can configure your sponsor button by editing the FUNDING.yml](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository).

   ```FUNDING.yml
   github: darksaid98
   github: SOME_OTHER_USER
   ```
3. #### Change [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   If you choose to adopt the Code of Conduct in this template, please replace `GITHUB_CONTACT_EMAIL` at line 63 with
   your preferred method of contact. Otherwise replace or remove it.
4. #### Change [Project Name](./settings.gradle.kts)
   Replace all occurances of `ExamplePlugin` with your new plugin name. Don't forget to rename the main
   class [ExamplePlugin.java](./src/main/java/com/github/ExampleUser/ExamplePlugin/ExamplePlugin.java) to the same
   value.
   ```kotlin
   rootProject.name = "MyName"
   ```
5. #### Change [build.gradle.kts](./build.gradle.kts)
    1. ##### Change Plugin Info
       Don't forget to change package locations in `src/main/java/` when changing the group.
       ```kotlin
       group = "io.github.darksaid98"
       version = "0.9.8"
       description = "Some plugin description here..."
       ```
    2. ##### Change Plugin.yml
       Update the authors list and any other required settings.
       ```kotlin
       authors = listOf("GITHUB_USERNAME") // Replace with your username
       contributors = listOf()
       apiVersion = "1.19"
 
       // Misc properties
       load = net.minecrell.pluginyml.bukkit.BukkitPluginDescription.PluginLoadOrder.POSTWORLD // STARTUP or POSTWORLD
       depend = listOf()
       softDepend = listOf()
       ```
    3. ##### Change Dependencies
       Lastly, remove/add any dependecies you don't need/want.

       > You can also make the development server install any plugin dependencies:
       ```kotlin
       downloadPlugins {
           //modrinth("carbon", "2.1.0-beta.21")
           //github("jpenilla", "MiniMOTD", "v2.0.13", "minimotd-bukkit-2.0.13.jar")
           //hangar("squaremap", "1.2.0")
           //url("https://download.luckperms.net/1515/bukkit/loader/LuckPerms-Bukkit-5.4.102.jar")
           github("MilkBowl", "Vault", "1.7.3", "Vault.jar")
       }
       ```

---

## Testing & Debugging

The template includes [jpenilla's run-task](https://github.com/jpenilla/run-task) gradle plugin. This allows you to
easily setup and run a development server for your plugin.

By default IntelliJ IDEA has excellent integration for debugging, and enables running your test server with a debugger
attached, in one click.

If using other IDEs you can connect a debugger to port `5005` which the development server listens on by default.

### Development Server

1. Run `gradlew runServer` to start a minecraft server on `localhost:25565`.

### Debugging (_IntelliJ IDEA_)

The Development Server is configured to work with the IntelliJ Debugger by default.

Simply press the `Debug` button to launch your Development Server with a Debugger attached.

### Debugging (External Debugger)

> [!NOTE]
> The steps here are mirrored
> from [PaperMC's Guide](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/debugging#using-a-remote-debugger) and are meant for IntelliJ
> IDEA. Other IDEs may be similar.

1. Open the `Run/Debug Configurations` page by clicking `Edit Configurations...`.
   ![Edit Configuration Image](https://i.imgur.com/rO4wXXN.png)

2. Click the `+` button in the _top left_ and select `Remote JVM Debug`.

3. Name the config whatever you want (_like Debug_), then hit `Apply`.
   ![Configuration Image](https://i.imgur.com/4M0LgZU.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Development Server listens for Debuggers on port 5005.

4. When your Development Server is running, connect your debugger by pressing the `Debug` button.

- **[leviem1:](https://github.com/leviem1)** _For their excellent [__Spigot plugin-template__](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template) which this was originally a fork of. I highly recommend their more minimalistic and much less opinionated template._
- **[A248:](https://github.com/A248)** _For exposing me to Flyway and jOOQ, inspiring me to include it in this template. I highly recommend you check out their projects [LibertyBans](https://github.com/A248/LibertyBans) & [MorePaperLib](https://github.com/A248/MorePaperLib) which are of exceptional quality._
